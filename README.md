## 🎯 The Philosophy

> *"You cannot close this window. Please contemplate why."*

HorseOS interrupts doomscrolling and overwork with mandatory "Horse Moments" — absurdist breaks that force contemplation and reflection.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Wait for startup** — Classic Windows 98 boot sequence (3 seconds)
2. **Experience Horse Moment** — Auto-launches with 60-second countdown
3. **Explore desktop** — Double-click icons to open apps
4. **Play Minesweeper** — Left click to reveal, right click to flag
5. **Browse horse facts** — Internet Explorer has a typewriter effect
6. **Shut down** — Click Start → Shut Down

## 🎮 Easter Eggs
